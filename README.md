# Survival
It is mainly an experiment to try a WebGL based framework. I'm using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
([Repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)).

It's a classic survival, so the objetive of the game is to stay alive as long as possible while killing
as many enemies as possible. The name is totally **WIP**. The main inspiration for the logic of the game
is [BoxHead](http://www.boxheadgame.com/). I'm trying to get rid of Flash.

Stuff will be added and may end up being something fun.
